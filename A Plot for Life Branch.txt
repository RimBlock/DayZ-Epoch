This is the merge version of A Plot for Life for inclusion in the DayZ Epoch v1.0.6 mod.

A Plot for Life enables players to keep ownership of their buildables after death.

This version can be turned no or off with a variable (see options below).

Other features.
 - Take Ownership
 - - Historical bases can be brought in to use the new system via a "Take Ownership" option which is available for the plot owner at the plot pole.
 - - The "Take Ownership" option can also be used for raiding and base takeover.
 - - The "Take Ownership" option can be turned on or off with a variable (see options below).
 - - Players cannot take ownership of locked items (doors / lockboxes / safes).

 - New utility functions
 - - fn_check_owner: To check ownership and friendly status
 - - fn_find_plots: To get all nearby plot poles and return a count and the nearest alive one (if one exists).

 - Plot Boundary
 - - You can now turn on the plot boundary from the plot pole and remove it.

 - Modular Build System
 - - Updates to allow passing of variables rather than regathering them.
 - - Updates to use the new utility functions.
 
 - General code tuning
 - - Changed nearestObjects to nearEntities.
 - - Change forEach to Count where _forEachIndex is not used.
 - - Various small changes to various blocks of code for better speed.

 - Includes Precise Base Building
 - - Precise Base Building is included with kind permission of Mikeeeyy (http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/user/17080-mikeeeyy/)
 - - PBB saves the object locations as strings so removes the rounding errors that produce gaps in walls etc.
 - - PBB leverages the number / float to string functions written by KillZone Kid (http://killzonekid.com/)
